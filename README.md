<Hello GitWorld>
  
Consulting in the ICT industry for several years, now I´m a lover of development projects of web systems, exploring new opportunities to involve more in the IT field, and focusing on customer needs solutions with creativity and innovative view.
Living different experiences such as Telecommunications, Tech Lead projects, sales, consultant, and development of systems.

I've led many projects for the government to connect networks and IT services.

Some of the skills very common in my work style are a sense of duty, partnership, focus on solutions, and agility.
In all jobs, I became a tech reference and built beautiful legacies by helping the company accomplish goals.

My tech skills are fixed on network and cloud architectures, web applications such as websites, software requirements, project management

I also share tips and tendencies on my LinkedIn channel, I think that it is important to share my experiences during my tech journey to inspire other girls.
